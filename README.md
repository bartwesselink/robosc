# RoboSC
This repository contains the source code of the RoboSC (RSC) language. This domain-specific language (DSL) supports and accelerates the development of safe, autonomous robots. The language allows developers to model the components and communications of each robot, and specify requirements for them. Using supervisory control synthesis, a controller is constructed that can run as a node on the execution platform.

A presentation that highlights the capabilities of the languages can be found [here](https://robosc.bartwesselink.nl).

## Supported execution platforms
Currently, the DSL supports the generation of controllers for:

* ROS1
* ROS2
