# Robot Supervisory Controller DSL
This repository contains the source code of the Robot Supervisory Controller DSL (RSCD). This domain-specific language (DSL) supports and accelerates the development of safe, autonomous robots. The language allows developers to model the components and communications of each robot, and specify requirements for them. Using supervisory control synthesis, a controller is constructed that can run as a node on the execution platform.

## Supported execution platforms
Currently, the DSL supports the generation of controllers for:

* ROS1
* ROS2
